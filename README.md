# Sunspots-Prediction-With-Tensorflow-Keras

This notebook is one of those i wrote as practise for the Tensorflow Certificate Exam

The Data i used are monthly statements of sunspot from 1749 to 2018 from Tensorflow Datasets API.

I tried to predict the last month of the year based on the 11 previous months based on the total sunspots mean number and the months. The implementation is fully with Tensorflow except Data Processing.

I use three keras models :

    One fully Dense(DNN) Neural Network
    One LSTM-DNN Neural Network
    One CNN-DNN Neural Network
